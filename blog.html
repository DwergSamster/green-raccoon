        <b>My action for less waste (Sam van Hoof)
        <br/>
        4/12/2019</b>
        <br/>
        <b>Plan 1: get your food from the farmer directly</b>
        <br/>
        1: if there is a farmer close to your house you can always go to there and ask if you can get veggies straight from his farm.
        <br/>
        2: some farmers are nice enough to give you a weekly or monthly supply of vegetables for a nice price.
        <br/>
        3: you could probably also find farmers who sell their crops on google, do make sure that it isn’t packed in a lot of plastic, preferably non.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Plan 2: less CO2</b>
        <br/>
        1: cars exhaust a lot of CO2
        <br/>
        2: if you inflate your tires every month or so, you will use less CO2 because there’s less friction.

        <b>Recipe action (Noah Smalburg)
        <br/>
        4/12/2019</b>
        <br/>
        <b>This action is made to make people realise that living waste free isn't that hard and doesn’t cost that much money.</b>
        <br/>
        The action is eating a day with no waste and putting the recipes of the food that you eat on the greenraccoon.com.
        <br/>
        This action is something me and my parents are doing for over 3 years, we buy food with no waste and if we buy food with for instance plastic around it, it is only on special occasions like birthdays.
        <br/>
        Some tips for living waste-free is that some types of cardboard and paper can be easily dissolved in water and that some types of plastic also dissolve fast.
        <br/>
        People that think it is really hard to make meals that are waste free can use the recipes that you put on the site to help them, so you aren't only reducing your own waste, but you are also reducing the waste of others.
        <br/>
        The recipes don’t have to be that hard, it doesn’t have to be a 5-star restaurant meal. A lot of people would be helped by for instance a good way to make soup.
        You can also give tips for others on using less plastic or eating less meat or link an article on some good alternatives to meat.
